The Project developed was an Experimental Project that has been developed for the Analysis of Heart stroke predicition using Different ML Models.
A seperate Dataset was extracted from the datasets available in Kaggle. The dataset contains different variables of age,gender, etc.
It mainly talks about which type of lifestyle or which type of workstyle is more prone to a stroke.
The Code can be modified based on the dataset trained and may display different results.
A detailed piechart explains, which model best predicts this trained and cleaned dataset.
